# Session Rules

Each session, in order - do not skip:
1. Read AGENTS.md (root)
2. Read docs/agents/<you>/AGENTS.md
3. Read docs/shared/task_board.md
4. Read your open task file
5. Claim task if not yet claimed
6. Work - checkpoint frequently
7. Write human output to deliverables/<task_slug>/README.md
8. Complete via: scripts/bootstrap.sh complete <slug> --agent <you>

These steps cost few tokens. Skipping them causes drift and mistakes.
